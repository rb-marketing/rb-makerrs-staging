                  The year-end is a time when we get together with family and
                  friends, celebrate and feast. This is probably why Swiggy hits
                  its peak orders season between Christmas and New Year’s.
                </div>
                <div className="leading-7 mb-[30px]">
                  In this super busy season, Swiggy relies heavily on Delivery
                  Partners to handle the huge wave of incoming orders. They need
                  all the Partners they already have, and then some! Think of it
                  like “delivery partner wars”. Swiggy needed to engage its
                  delivery partners with great offers and excite those from
                  competing apps too. Their approach: awesome deals, bigger
                  earnings, mega guarantees, and extra bonuses.

                <div className="leading-7 mb-[30px]">
                  The brief was a digital campaign to spread the word on great
                  seasonal benefits and encourage more Delivery Partner
                  engagement as well as sign-ups. And the content needed to be
                  super-relatable for the TG.

                Their charm and relatability created a special place in the
                hearts of our target audience. And, we saw a fantastic
                opportunity to deepen this connection and continue their story

                  Well, time had passed since Pankaj and Sweety were newlyweds.
                  All things given - theirs has grown to be a happy married
                  life. And the romance is very much still alive.

                <div className="mb-4 md:mb-[30px]">
                  So, to highlight the EXTRA incentives Swiggy was dishing out
                  this festive season, we showed Pyaare Pankaj earning EXTRA
                  with Swiggy, just to keep Sweety EXTRA happy.

                  Watch the two films and find out what Pyare Pankaj does to woo
                  his Sweetie over and over again with a little EXTRA. These are
                  just an inspiration for the many things a Delivery Partner
                  could do with their EXTRA earnings with Swiggy.

                <div className="mb-[6px] md:mb-0">
                  The films significantly boosted Delivery Partner engagement
