            client upon receipt of full and final payment for the commissioned
            work.

            In some cases though, the copyright is not assigned or transferred

            artists on a case-by-case basis, and usually are for a year or three

          <br />
          <p>
            1. Client-Agency Collaboration and Project Management: Our creative
            cloud platform allows us to capture briefs and collaborate with our
            clients, internal teams and our curated global network of creative
            collaborators. Project schedules as well as interactive reviews of
            films and videos, and final asset delivery are all done on the

            Effects, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Bridge, Final Cut Pro, Da Vinci
            Resolve, Eleven Labs, Filmora and Adobe Podcast, amongst others. If
            a creative project requires the use of specific tools or technology
            platforms that we don’t have ready subscriptions to, we are happy to
            acquire suitable licenses and deploy the tools at an additional
