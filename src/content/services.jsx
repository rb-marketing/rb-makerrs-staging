We work closely with your talent or employer branding team to identify the right voices - employees, leaders, new joiners - and shape a narrative that captures their genuine experiences. We guide people on camera so they come across as comfortable and natural, not rehearsed. We also avoid scripting testimonials too tightly wherever possible. Instead, we shape the story around real emotions, cultural values, and day-to-day experiences with simple talking points to get authentic content. We also visualize and capture supporting B-roll footage to enhance the narrative in a relatable manner.',

We also provide prep materials ahead of time, keep the shoot informal, and allow multiple takes so there’s no pressure to get it right the first time.

Our process includes briefing and goal alignment, concept development, project planning, scripting, graphic design, production across locations, followed by post-production, which includes editing, music, subtitles, voice-over, and animation.

            communication needs.

            interactive review feature to share frame-accurate comments and
            respond to our creative suggestions – all without lengthy email
            chains or missed feedback. Additionally, all video drafts on the

          </li>
          <li className="mb-5">
            - Once the project is complete, your video assets are uploaded to
            our platform. Everything is neatly organised, downloadable,
            shareable with colleagues and partners, and ready for repurposing in
            the future.

        <div>
          Project turnaround times vary based on the format, scale of production
          as well as the type of service. Here’s a little guidance for each of
          our services.
        </div>
        <h3 className="mt-5 font-semibold  text-base">1. Strategy</h3>
        <div>
          A smaller ask such as researching and defining your content strategy
          could take up to 4 weeks, but a larger ask such as brand strategy
          could take up to 2 months depending on the amount of research and
          analysis required.
        </div>
        <h3 className="mt-5 font-semibold  text-base">2. Design</h3>
        <div>
          Depending on the requirement, the timeline varies. A simple brochure
          may take a week. A branded tee may take a couple of days for an
          existing brand. And a whole new brand identity system could take
          anywhere between 2 and 6 months depending on the expanse of the brief.
        </div>
        <h3 className="mt-5 font-semibold  text-base">3. Videos</h3>
        <div>
          Depending on the format and the scale of the project, as well as
          depending on how quickly we receive your feedback - we take anywhere
          between 10 and 40 working days to turnaround a brief. When we are
          making a longer-duration video (that’s not a simple testimonial video
          or an interview video) or an interactive video, this timeline might
          stretch to over 45 days. A short series of videos could be produced in
          45 days and a larger requirement - for example, YouTube content to
          grow subscribers and community - could be run as a year-long project.
        </div>
        <h3 className="mt-5 font-semibold  text-base">4. Campaign</h3>
        <div>
          Workflows and timelines are highly customized and responsive for this
          service. A simple campaign could be created in 30 working days from
          the formal contract or take up to 90 days - this is subject to the
          brief, the scale of the requirement, as well as dependencies on the
          client-side.
        </div>
        <h3 className="mt-5 font-semibold  text-base">
          5. Artificial Intelligence

        <div>
          From using GenAI to generate video and imagery for brand

          and develop AI-integrated communications for B2B brands.
        </div>
        <h3 className="mt-5 font-semibold  text-base">6. Technology</h3>
        <div>
          When it comes to technology, the conceptualisation, research,
          consulting, design and development process could vary between as
          little as 1 month for a microsite, 4 months for a website (including
          all the graphics and content) and up to 12 months for a branded game.
          Turnaround times similarly vary for other services such as augmented
          reality, private social apps, etc.
        </div>
        <h3 className="mt-5 font-semibold  text-base">7. Crews</h3>
        <div>
          Typically, we can get a curated video crew in place in as little as 3
          working days. And post the shoot, we could either handover the files
          at the shoot on a hard disk or quality-check the footage and deliver
          it online 28 hours post the shoot.
